    ITM TA3 MVP API

    This is the specification of a proposed TA3 API for the In The Moment (ITM) Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  It is based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.  Some objects and operations are not necessarily planned for the MVP, but are currently present for fostering discussion.  The API is currently in an early/draft state, even for an MVP.  # noqa: E501

    OpenAPI spec version: 0.0.2
